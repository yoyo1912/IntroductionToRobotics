Student: Ioana-Cristina Ursoiu
Group: 364

  ->This GitHub repository is dedicated to my coursework and projects for the "Introduction to Robotics" laboratory in my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment and project is documented here and includes the respective requirements, implementation details, code, and image files. This repository serves as a portfolio for my work in the course.
	
 ->I hope you will enjoy your jorney in understanding my homeworks. I can assure you, my code is not hard to read, it's just misunderstood. 

 # My repo pun
 
 Why do programmers believe 1+1 equals 10? Because they're always in a binary state of mind, while the rest of us insist that 1+1 is just 2-funny!
