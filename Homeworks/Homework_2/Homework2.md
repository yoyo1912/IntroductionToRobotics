#                                                            Homework 2

This is the first homework using arduino. I had to control each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers. 

## Components
* RGB LED
* Potentiometers x3
* Resistors x3
* Wires x14

## Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

## Project difficulties 
The cable management was the worst part. I still couldn't think of a better way to arrange the wires. Too many wires for a little breadboard.
